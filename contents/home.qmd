Hi!👋 I am **Isidora Araya Day**, a theoretical condensed matter physicist working on **mesoscopic superconductivity, topology, and quantum transport**.

📍 Currently I am a postdoc at DIPC in San Sebastián, Spain, working with [Adolfo Grushin](https://grushingroup.cnrs.fr/).

💻 I did my PhD in the [Quantum Tinkerer group](http://quantumtinkerer.group/) at TU Delft, The Netherlands, with [Anton Akhmerov](https://antonakhmerov.org/) and [Michael Wimmer](https://michaelwimmer.org/).

I love working on problems that require combining analytics and numerics.
One of my favorite projects so far was developing **Pymablock**, an open-source Python package to do quantum mechanical perturbation theory efficiently, numerically and symbolically.
