- abstract: A common technique in the study of complex quantum-mechanical systems
    is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian by using quasi-degenerate
    perturbation theory. While the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation achieves this
    and constructs an effective Hamiltonian, its scaling is suboptimal, and implementing
    it efficiently is both challenging and error-prone. We introduce an algorithm
    for constructing an equivalent effective Hamiltonian as well as a Python package,
    Pymablock, that implements it. Our algorithm combines an optimal asymptotic scaling
    with a range of other improvements. The package supports numerical and analytical
    calculations of any order and it is designed to be interoperable with any other
    packages for specifying the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the package handles
    constructing a k.p model, analyses a superconducting qubit, and computes the low-energy
    spectrum of a large tight-binding model. We also compare its performance with
    reference calculations and demonstrate its efficiency.

- abstract: We demonstrate that Andreev modes that propagate along a transparent Josephson
    junction have a perfect transmission at the point where three junctions meet.
    The chirality and the number of quantized transmission channels is determined
    by the topology of the Fermi surface and the vorticity of the superconducting
    phase differences at the trijunction. We explain this chiral adiabatic transmission
    (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the scattering modes both
    in momentum and real space. We identify an effective energy barrier that guarantees
    quantized transmission. We expect that CAT is observable in nonlocal conductance
    and thermal transport measurements. Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole
    symmetry, CAT is also possible to observe directly in metamaterials.

  title: Chiral adiabatic transmission protected by Fermi surface topology
- abstract: We derive a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological invariant that extends beyond symmetry
    eigenvalues and Wilson loops and classifies two-dimensional insulators with a
    $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry. To formulate this invariant, we consider an irreducible
    Brillouin zone and constrain the spectrum of the open Wilson lines that compose
    its boundary. We fix the gauge ambiguity of the Wilson lines by using the Pfaffian
    at high symmetry momenta. As a result, we distinguish the four $C_4 \mathcal{T}$-protected
    atomic insulators, each of which is adiabatically connected to a different atomic
    limit. We establish the correspondence between the invariant and the obstructed
    phases by constructing both the atomic limit Hamiltonians and a $C_4 \mathcal{T}$-symmetric
    model that interpolates between them. The phase diagram shows that $C_4 \mathcal{T}$
    insulators allow $\pm 1$ and $2$ changes of the invariant, where the latter is
    overlooked by symmetry indicators.

- abstract: We show that topological defects in quadrupole insulators do not host
    quantized fractional charges, contrary to what their Wannier representation indicates.
    In particular, we test the charge quantization hypothesis based on the Wannier
    representation of a parametric defect and a disclination. Against the expectations,
    we find that the local charge density decays as $\sim 1/r^2$ with distance, leading
    to a diverging defect charge. We identify sublattice symmetry and not higher order
    topology as the origin of the previously reported charge quantization.

- abstract: We report on an experimental, theoretical and numerical study of slanted
    snaking of spatially localized parametrically excited waves on the surface of
    a water-surfactant mixture in a Hele-Shaw cell. We demonstrate experimentally
    the presence of a hysteretic transition to spatially extended parametrically excited
    surface waves when the acceleration amplitude is varied, as well as the presence
    of spatially localized waves exhibiting slanted snaking. The latter extend outside
    the hysteresis loop. We attribute this behavior to the presence of a conserved
    quantity, the liquid volume, and introduce a universal model based on symmetry
    arguments, which couples the wave amplitude with such a conserved quantity. The
    model captures both the observed slanted snaking and the presence of localized
    waves outside the hysteresis loop, as demonstrated by numerical integration of
    the model equations.

- abstract: We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins
    that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling
    network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers
    of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry
    off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple
    stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error
    correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept
    is experimentally feasible.

  title: Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits
- abstract: The surface states of intrinsic higher order topological phases are protected
    by the spatial symmetries of a finite sample. This property makes the existing
    scattering theory of topological invariants inapplicable because the scattering
    geometry is either incompatible with the symmetry or does not probe the bulk topology.
    We resolve this obstacle by using a symmetric scattering geometry that probes
    transport from the inside to the outside of the sample. We demonstrate that the
    intrinsic higher order topology is captured by the flux dependence of the reflection
    matrix. Our finding follows from identifying the spectral flow of a flux line
    as a signature of higher order topology. We show how this scattering approach
    applies to several examples of higher order topological insulators and superconductors.
    Our theory provides an alternative approach for proving bulk--edge correspondence
    in intrinsic higher order topological phases, especially in presence of disorder.
