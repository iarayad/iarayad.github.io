Mesoscopic systems often benefit from this approach: they are small enough to behave quantum mechanically, and yet large enough to require several degrees of freedom to describe them.\n\n\n\nTwo-dimensional devices offer the possibility of combining different materials such that different properties combine and give rise to tailored phenomena. For example, placing a superconductor in close proximity to a semiconductor turns the latter into a superconductor via the proximity effect, and allows to design Josephson junctions with highly tunable properties.

A Chern insulator, for example, hosts two counter-propagating edge states that may not disappear unless the bulk undergoes a delocalization transition. A powerful tool to characterize these phases are scattering invariants, which rely on a transport setup to probe the topological properties of a system.
